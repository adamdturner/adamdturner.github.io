## Overview

For an embedded systems class project I implemented the classic Snake game on ESP32 with an LCD display, menu buttons, and joystick for snake movement.

## Notes

- had to read documentation for the drivers
- programmed the ESP32 with C code
- wrote out the state machine and tick function for snake movement etc.
