## Overview

As part of the Global Engineering Outreach program at BYU I was one of 5 team members on the wood-burning cookstove sensor project. The goal was to build and calibrate a sensor unit that takes in CO, CO2 and particulate matter measurments, and outputs the readings to both an LCD screen and an SD card. The use of this sensor is to detect harmful emmissions of wood-burning cookstoves to certify that the stoves are functioning safely for use in homes. We partnered on this project with SENCICO in Lima, Peru, who is the primary user of this sensor device.

## Highlights

- Calibration of the CO and CO2 sensors using controlled gas flow in a fume hood
- Arduino programming in C++, using state machines and buttons to toggle through menu options
- Data collection and logging
