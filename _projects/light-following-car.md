## Overview

A small autonomous car that uses photoresistors to detect light direction and navigate toward it while handling basic avoidance.

## Highlights

- Analog sensor reading
- PWM Motor control
- Basic obstacle handling with sonar range finder
- Capacitive touch sensor for speed control

## Result

Reliable tracking under varied lighting with smooth motor response.
