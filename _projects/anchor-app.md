## Overview

Anchor is a personal app that I built for my own individual use, as a way to learn more about AI generated code. It was test project to see how well I can code with Cursor AI. The app itself is a multi-purpose habit tracker, workout tracker, goal setting and goal tracking app. It is expandable and scaleable so that I can add whatever additional types of tracking that I want, including tracking books you've read or are currently reading. 

## Highlights

- Vibe coding, cursor
- Flutter (dart), with Firebase Auth and firestore database
- Flutter BLoC for state management

## Notes

It is unlikely that I would bring this app to production for other people to use, but it is a fun personal learning experience.
