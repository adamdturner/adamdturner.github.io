## Overview

Grapevine is a cross-platform mobile application designed to allow users to tell their friends about products and services they buy. People are already doing this everyday, so Grapevine steps in to reward people for telling each other about the stuff they own. When someone scans their friend's Grapevine referral code, they are taken immediately to a checkout page to buy the item. Upon purchase, the one who referred the item gets a cash reward directly from the vendor. Vendors don't have to pay for advertising upfront, they only pay people when a purchase is made.
