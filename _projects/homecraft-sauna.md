## Overview

I assisted in the development of a sauna controller, which connects the sauna control board (running on ESP32) to wifi to fetch schedule updates from firebase that were set by the sauna mobile app user. The mobile app allows users to turn their sauna on and off and set the temperature. They may also schedule the sauna to be on at a certain time and duration.

## Highlights

- ESP32-based firmware with state machine
- Temperature sensing, safety cutoffs, and error handling
- Mobile app control

## Responsibilities

Firmware development, Firebase Auth on firmware, and system testing.
