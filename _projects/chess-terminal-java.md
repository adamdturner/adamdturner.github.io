## Overview

This was a class project where I developed a command-line chess game with board rendering, move parsing, legal move generation, illegal move detection, check/checkmate detection, and game state persistence. You can open mutliple terminal windows and connect to the same chess game to play against each other or join as an observer.

## Highlights

- Object-oriented design for pieces and rules
- Move validation and checkmate detection
- Client-server handshake whenever moves are made, sends notification to opponent when it's their turn
