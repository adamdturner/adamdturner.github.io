## Project Overview

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance through advanced techniques including data augmentation, batch normalization, and transfer learning.

## Key Features

- **High Accuracy**: 94% accuracy on CIFAR-10 test set
- **Data Augmentation**: Advanced techniques to improve model generalization
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages pre-trained models for better performance
- **Real-time Prediction**: Web interface for live image classification
- **Model Visualization**: Tools for understanding model decisions
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed performance metrics and confusion matrices

## Technical Implementation

### Model Architecture
```python
# Custom CNN Architecture
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Dropout(0.25),
    
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Dropout(0.25),
    
    Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Dropout(0.25),
    
    Flatten(),
    Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

### Data Preprocessing
- **Normalization**: Pixel values scaled to [0,1] range
- **Data Augmentation**: Rotation, shifting, flipping, and zooming
- **Class Balancing**: Ensured equal representation of all classes
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold validation for robust evaluation

### Training Strategy
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Cosine annealing with warm restarts
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting with patience monitoring
- **Model Checkpointing**: Saves best model during training
- **Mixed Precision**: Accelerated training with FP16

## Advanced Techniques

### Data Augmentation Pipeline
```python
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=15,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    zoom_range=0.1,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)
```
