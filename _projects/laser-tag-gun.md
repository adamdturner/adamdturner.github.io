## Overview

This was an 8 month project as part of my junior year in Electrical/Computer Engineering using LED's and photo diodes to transmit and recieve signals. We designed the PCB which had both the LED (transmission) and photo diode (reciever) mounted on, with op-amps for signal amplification and filters for noise reduction. The signal was then sent to the ESP32 input, and the ESP was programmed for hit detection, signal transmission (laser shooting) and all of the gameplay functionality.

## Highlights

- Band-pass signal filtration
- Low-latency timers and interrupt usage
- C programming on ESP32
- PCB design
